## About

<p>Simple code to create a Sierpinski triangle in wpf form. The creation occurs so that when you press the button, points are created alternately, creating first the base triangle and then the Sierpinski triangle. During the program, you can see the number of points that have already been created, as well as the creation itself.</p>

## Installation

1. download WpfApp
2. open WpfApp1.sln
3. run a program.
